# Meteor OAuth2 provider
This is a simple OAuth2 provider made in Meteor

## // WARNING //
As it stands this **is *NOT* secure at all** and shouldn't be used in production without **heavy** modifications to the publish/subscribe methods and separating the client from server code. I will definitely continue working on it and in the future transform it into a package that can be dropped into any Meteor project to open up for the possibility to share the accounts in-between Meteor instances.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute, it will make my life easier, even such things as finding small stupid errors I (or someone else for that matter, tho that isn't as probable) made is awesome and appreciated. It will also bring this project another step closer to completion.
