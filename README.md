# neutrino
An OAuth2 provider solution for Meteor.

**Test it for yourself at http://novauth.meteor.com/**

**Also, help me come up with a better name for the project over at twitter (@novium_) or open a new issue.**

## // WARNING //
As it stands this **is *NOT* secure at all** and shouldn't be used in production without **heavy** modifications to the publish/subscribe methods and separating the client from server code. I will definitely continue working on it and in the future make a package that can be dropped into any Meteor project to open up for the possibility to share the accounts in-between Meteor and/or other kinds of services that support oauth2.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute, it will make my life easier, even such things as
finding small stupid errors I (or someone else for that matter, tho that isn't
as probable) made is awesome and appreciated. It will also bring this project
another step closer to completion.

## Why neutrino?
The neutrino is an elementary particle that flies across space, it seems to be
possible to send data using them at incredible speeds across the solar system
and through Earths core; that isn't too far off from the goal of this project.
Also, space, meteor.
